       <h2> Financial Associate</h2>

	<h2 style="text-align: center;font-family: Arial; font-size: 30px"> <u>Who Am I?</u> </h2>
	    <p> I am a native from <a href="http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/cameroon.htm"> Cameroon</a> in Africa. I have been living in the United States for about 16 years in New York City. I have been working at Citibank for 3 and half years since I graduated college. </p>
	
	<h2 style="text-align: center;font-family: Arial; font-size: 30px"> <u> Why Should I Be Accepted into TKH's Advance JavaScript Course? </u></h2>
	<p> I want to be accepted to be a part of TKH’s upcoming Advanced JavaScript course because in order to successfully compete in today’s workforce, you have to have the some kind of technical skill set as we have become very much reliant on technology for the past 10-20 years. </p>
	    <p> During my <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/"> undergraduate</a>, I focused on Finance. Being in the workforce has shown me that there will come a day when my job will be <em>replaced by a bot or a machine</em>. </p>
	<p> I cannot predict when that will happen but I can start <em>preparing</em> myself for when that day does come, I will have a back plan through the skill set I can possible attain if I am accepted to the Advanced JavaScript program. </p>
